# Bypassing MDM/DEP on MacBook with Ventura

This guide explains how to bypass the Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Device Enrollment Program (DEP) on an MacBook running macOS Ventura. The method outlined below has been tested and proven effective, though subsequent macOS updates may impact its reliability.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An MacBook Pro running macOS Ventura.
- Administrative(root) access to your MacBook.
- [Optional]Access to your network router's settings to block specific domains.

## Steps

### Block MDM and DEP Related Domains

1. **[Optional]Block Necessary Domains on Your Router:**
   - `iprofiles.apple.com`
   - `mdmenrollment.apple.com`
   - `deviceenrollment.apple.com`

2. **Skip Internet Connection on First Install:**
   - During the initial macOS setup, choose to skip connecting to the internet.

3. **Update /etc/hosts File:**
   - On your first login (without network), open Terminal and run the following commands:
     ```bash
     echo 0.0.0.0 iprofiles.apple.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
     echo 0.0.0.0 mdmenrollment.apple.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
     echo 0.0.0.0 deviceenrollment.apple.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
     ```

4. **Remove Any Lingering Profiles:**
   - To clear any pre-existing configurations:
     ```bash
     sudo profiles remove -all
     ```

### Additional Steps (Optional)

1. **Install Little Snitch Firewall:**
   - Install Little Snitch to control incoming and outgoing network connections, targeting:
     - `/usr/libexec/teslad`
     - `/usr/libexec/mdmclient`
   - Also, ensure to block the previously mentioned hosts.

2. **Disable System Services:**
   - Turn off services to prevent them from communicating:
     ```bash
     sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.devicemanagementclient.teslad
     sudo launchctl disable gui/501/com.apple.mdmclient.agent
     ```

## Troubleshooting

- **MDM/DEP Still Active:** Ensure that the domain blocks and `/etc/hosts` entries are correct and active. Reboot your system to apply changes.
- **Restoring Settings:** To undo the changes, remove the entries from `/etc/hosts` and reset your router settings.

## FAQs

**Q: Will this bypass affect system updates?**
A: No, system updates should proceed normally, but be aware that some updates may reinstate MDM/DEP functionalities.

**Q: Is this process reversible?**
A: Yes, you can reverse all changes by restoring original `/etc/hosts` entries and router configurations.

## Backup Advice

Always back up your data before making significant system changes. Use Time Machine or your preferred backup solution to create a complete system backup.

## Ethical Considerations

This guide is intended for educational purposes. Bypassing MDM/DEP might violate terms of service and can have legal and ethical implications, especially if the device is not personally owned.

## Updates and Version Compatibility

This guide probably will not be updated as new macOS versions are released.
