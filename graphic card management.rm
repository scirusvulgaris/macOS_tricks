These commands provide control over how the GPU switching feature is managed under different power conditions, allowing users to tailor their system's performance and energy usage based on their specific needs or operating environments.

Ensure that you're operating these commands with administrative privileges (`sudo`), as changing power management settings requires root access. Also, it's always good practice to check the effects of these settings to ensure they meet your expectations, especially if system stability and battery life are concerns.

Here is a comprehensive overview of how you can configure this setting. This is based on the common usage of `pmset` parameters that apply to other settings as well.

### Basic `pmset` Options with `gpuswitch`

The `gpuswitch` parameter can be set using the following `pmset` flags to control which power source the settings should apply to:

- **`-a` (all)**: Apply the GPU switching setting to all power sources (battery, wall power, UPS).
- **`-b` (battery)**: Apply the GPU switching setting only when the MacBook is running on battery power.
- **`-c` (charger)**: Apply the GPU switching setting only when the MacBook is connected to an AC power source.

### Commands to Set `gpuswitch`

Here are the commands you would use to enable or disable automatic graphics switching for each power source scenario:

1. **Enable Automatic Graphics Switching for All Power Sources**:
   ```bash
   sudo pmset -a gpuswitch 1
   ```

2. **Disable Automatic Graphics Switching for All Power Sources**:
   ```bash
   sudo pmset -a gpuswitch 0
   ```

3. **Enable Automatic Graphics Switching Only on Battery**:
   ```bash
   sudo pmset -b gpuswitch 1
   ```

4. **Disable Automatic Graphics Switching Only on Battery**:
   ```bash
   sudo pmset -b gpuswitch 0
   ```

5. **Enable Automatic Graphics Switching Only When Plugged In**:
   ```bash
   sudo pmset -c gpuswitch 1
   ```

6. **Disable Automatic Graphics Switching Only When Plugged In**:
   ```bash
   sudo pmset -c gpuswitch 0
   ```
